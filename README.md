# k_syntax_
A mock-up of a made-up programming language inside of C using #define preprocessor directives. It's called 'K'.
why this README is so short?

make sure u compile it like

```batch
gcc [YOUR_FILE].c k_syntax_source.c -o [YOUR_EXECUTABLE]
```
that source file is necessary.

how does an avg k program look like?

```cpp
// get the k_syntax header and its source in a folder/directory.
#include "k_syntax.h"

start
 output("hi.\n"); // 'hi'
 joutput("wassup light_jh1.\n"); // 'wassup light-san'.
end
```

enjoy!
